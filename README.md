2016 Valentine's Day was an extremely cold day with wind chill alert throughout the day. I made the mistake of venturing downtown to watch a movie. The walk back from downtown was unbreably cold. I asked myself "What about the nearby region in New England?".

I answered my question by getting some data at 9:55pm on 14th Feb 2016. I put them on a map in ggplot2 to see what it's like. Apparently, I'm still fortunate compared to the folks up there in Canada..

I just wanted to visualize something since I have not done any visualization recently due to school work.
